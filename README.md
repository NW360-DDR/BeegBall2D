Update Log: 
11/4/2021:
 - 2:15PM - Created 2D Unity Project and decided to make an improved bullet hell game similar to Touhou, though scaled down. 
 Created super watered down main menu without any music or graphics save for buttons with text. 
 Disabled mouse cursor and learned how to finally make a navigatable menu using on ly the arrow keys. This unironically took longer than it should because I am stubborn and wanted to make it without looking anything up. Using the documentation of Unity does not count.
 - 5:06 PM Took a break to eat dinner.
 - 7:30 PM after a short stint in fixing the oven, ate dinner and got back to working on the main menu
 - 11:15 PM despite my best efforts, the traditional main menu will not suffice for what I want to do this time. 
 I will likely need to make scenes for each one to do what I want unless I can cheese the system somehow.

  - 11:55 AM - Gave up on previous idea entirely after two more hours f failing at the menu screen and decided to make a game similar to Red Ball 4, an old flash game.
  - Saving the game, possible, but best way to do it? Asked around on Internet/Game Design Discord.
  - Created graphics assets for Jimothy, JoMommathy, and the One-Way Gates.
  
11/17/2021
  - After celebrating my 21st birthday, and my parents pressuring me into trying a tequila shot, I decided two things:
  -- Tequila shots taste like piss smells
  -- Saving the game like I want to do, with the Lemons as collectible stars might not be too feasible for this short project.
  - Changed idea of game from platformer to arcade style collect-a-thon against another player.
  
12/2/2021
 - Realized I forgot about this game entirely and scrambled to make a presentable Alpha, including a scuffed timer, Lemon detection, and actual game loop.
 - Made boilerplate code to implement the Single Player modes I would inevitably need.
 - Photoshop subscription expired, all future graphics (if any) will now be made with Krita.
 
12/8/2021
 - Finished up Single Player Mode and Got Most of the way through making the Time Trial Mode. Forgot to fix the timer still incrementing once the game ends.
  
12/15/2021
 - Fixed up the Time Trial timer
 - Fixed a bug where in Single Player modes, the player would need to use the PLayer 2 Jump key instead of the Player 1 jump key. Good job, Nate.
 - Made the executive decision that this game sucks and there's no way I can save it at this point, but at the same time it's my fault that it got to this point so... sucks.
